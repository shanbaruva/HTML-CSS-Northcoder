        <img class ="one" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/NCI_swiss_cheese.jpg" alt="This image is a close-up of a light-colored piece of cheese with holes, placed on top of a white surface. The cheese appears to be made from sheep's milk and has a smooth texture. It is likely that this cheese was produced through the process of cheesemaking, as it shows signs of being processed and aged. The dominant colors in the image are white and yellow, with accents of brown and orange. This suggests that the cheese may have been made using butter or eggs during production.">
